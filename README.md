# LibreSplit Web Resources

This repository provides data for autosplitters and splits to the
[LibreSplit Resources Website](https://libresplit-resources.loomeh.is-a.dev).
It serves as the central hub for autosplitter and split files for
LibreSplit.

## Adding Your Autosplitter/Split File

1.  Upload your file to a hosting service (preferably GitHub/GitLab) that
    provides direct access to the text contents.
2.  Fork this repository.
3.  Add your entry to the appropriate CSV file.
4.  Submit a pull request.

## Rules

**1. No Malicious Code**

-   If any malicious code is found in your autosplitter, your PR will be
    rejected, and you will be permanently banned from submitting to this
    repository. If your autosplitter contains any unconventional code, please
    mention it in your PR description.

**2. No Blatant Obfuscation**

-   Autosplitter code should not be intentionally obfuscated. Refusal to
    unobfuscate your code will result in your PR being rejected.

**3. No Submitting Autosplitters for Multiplayer Games (with Exceptions)**

-   Multiplayer games typically have anti-cheat systems that will detect
    LibreSplit as a threat and will either block its functionality or punish
    the player. For this reason, submitting autosplitters for multiplayer games
    is typically not allowed. The exceptions to this rule are:

    -   Games with no anti-cheat system (such as Portal 2)
    -   Mods for single-player games that add multiplayer functionality (such as
        Super Mario 64 Coop DX)
    -   Games where the publisher has given explicit permission for LibreSplit
        to be used (your PR description must contain proof of approval if this
        is the case)
